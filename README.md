# Python Url Shortener

After making a demo project on [Go](https://github.com/alperdegre/go-url-shortener), I also wanted to try to rebuild the same backend with Python.

Without any prior experience with Python this backend took 3.5-4~ hours to complete and an extra hour or two to fix the frontend to work with different backends.

You can find a demo hosted at [https://short.alperdegre.com/](https://short.alperdegre.com/) that shares a frontend with [Go Url Shortener](https://github.com/alperdegre/go-url-shortener)
